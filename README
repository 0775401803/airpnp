airpnp 0.21

README
=================

Airpnp is a simple server that acts as a bridge between AirPlay devices (such as
the iPhone or the iPad) and regular UPnP media renderers. Its mode of operation
can be summarized as follows:

* When running, detects UPnP devices on the network through M-SEARCH discovery
  and notification monitoring.
* For each MediaRenderer found, publishes an AirPlay service with the
  corresponding name.
* Converts incoming AirPlay commands to UPnP control messages which are sent to
  the media renderer.

The software is based on totem-plugin-airplay version 1.0.2, which is included.
The server parts have been rewritten to use Twisted-based networking. The
official home for the plugin is:

     http://cgit.sukimashita.com/totem-plugin-airplay.git/.

The software also uses UPnP code from pyupnp, which is included. The official
home for pyupnp is:
