README
=================

Airpnp is a simple server that acts as a bridge between AirPlay devices (such as
the iPhone or the iPad) and regular UPnP media renderers. Its mode of operation
can be summarized as follows:

* When running, detects UPnP devices on the network through M-SEARCH discovery
  and notification monitoring.
* For each MediaRenderer found, publishes an AirPlay service with the
  corresponding name.
* Converts incoming AirPlay commands to UPnP control messages which are sent to
  the media renderer.

The software is based on totem-plugin-airplay version 1.0.2, which is included.
The server parts have been rewritten to use Twisted-based networking. The
official home for the plugin is:

     http://cgit.sukimashita.com/totem-plugin-airplay.git/.

The software also uses UPnP code from pyupnp, which is included. The official
home for pyupnp is:

Dependencies
------------
The code has been tested with Python 2.7, but probably works with some earlier
2.x versions as well.

External dependencies include Twisted Web, Avahi, and Mock (the latter is only
necessary for running tests). On a standard Ubuntu 11.04 server setup, the
following commands install the required dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install python-twisted-web python-avahi

For running tests:

    sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
    sudo apt-get install python-nose
    sudo easy_install mock

Version 0.7.0 of python-mock that exists in the Natty repositories is not
sufficient. As of this writing, easy_install provides version 0.8.0beta3.

The avahi daemon must be installed:

    sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon


Installation
------------
There is currently nothing to install. See Running below.


Configuration
-------------
See the CONFIGURATION file.


Running
-------
You *may* need to add a route for the 239 net:

    sudo route add -net 239.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 eth0

If avahi and dbus are not running, then:

    sudo service dbus start
    sudo service avahi-daemon start

To run airpnp, use the twistd runner. From the top-levl directory, issue the
following command:

    twistd airpnp

To run in the foreground, use the following command:

    twistd -n airpnp

To run a UPnP device discovery deamon in the foreground, use the following
command (uses ~/.airpnprc for configuration):

    twistd -n upnpdisc

To run unit tests, run the following from the top-level directory:

    nosetests
