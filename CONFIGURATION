CONFIGURATION
=================

Airpnp is configured through a file called .airpnprc, located in the current
user's home directory (i.e., ~/.airpnprc). The configuration file follows a
win.ini-like format, with sections and key-value pairs. Currently, the only
recognized section is "airpnp". See the AIRPNPRC file for an example.


Configuration parameters
------------------------
The following configuration parameters are recognized by airpnp:

* loglevel

Integer value from 0 to 3. The different log levels mean:

0 - only twistd/Twisted logging (not recommended)
1 - basic airpnp messages
2 - include detailed messages about operations
3 - include detailed messages about network communication (protocols)

The default value is 1.


* interactive_web

Boolean value (yes/no, on/off, True/False) that determines if the Interactive
Web server is started or not. The server hosts a very simple web that allows a
user to test the detected UPnP devices by sending control messages to them.

The default value is no.


* interactive_web_port

Integer value that specifies the port for the Interactive Web.

The default value is 28080.


* hostname

The host name used for dynamic URIs published to UPnP devices. Currently, such
URIs are only used for photos uploaded from AirPlay clients.

The host name can be a name or an IP address. The default value is the fully
qualified host name of the local computer.
